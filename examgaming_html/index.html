      <h1>Exam Gaming</h1>
      <h3>Problem ID: examgaming</h3>
    </div>Rasmus, Magnus, and Jonas have an upcoming exam in
    Algorithmic Problem Solving with their professor Martin. For
    their exam, they have been given a list of Kattis<a href=
    "#a0000000002" class="footnote"><sup class=
    "footnotemark">1</sup></a> problems and have to solve a number
    of them. They all consider themselves Kattis experts and hence
    are not concerned about their ability to solve all the
    problems. This has, however, led them to spend their time doing
    anything but solving problems. Now, less than a week before the
    deadline, when they have actually started looking at the pure
    amount of Kattis problems, they find that they have completely
    underestimated the workload.
    <p>With only 100 hours before deadline, it is now clear to them
    how unlikely it is that they will have time to complete all the
    problems in time. Yet, being the industrious students they
    obviously are, they have decided to make a ranking of each
    problem, as well as an estimate of how long it will take them
    to solve. Specifically, in an attempt please Martin (so that he
    doesn’t notice that not all the problems are solved), the
    ranking represents the groups guess at how happy a solution to
    the problem will make Martin.</p>
    <p>The group have different ideas for methods they can use to
    solve the Kattis excercises. For example, they could make a
    fast brute-force solution, but a dynamic programming solution,
    that takes longer time to implement, would make Martin happier.
    It will not make Martin any happier, if they solve the same
    Kattis problem twice or thrice using different methods.</p>
    <p>The group is very tight-knit and can only work on one
    problem at a time, all together. They need to figure out how
    many happy-points they can achieve before the deadline</p>
    <h2>Input</h2>
    <p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$1\leq n\leq 100000$</span> The following
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines contains
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$M$</span>, <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$P$</span> and <span class=
    "tex2jax_process">$T$</span>.</p>
    <ul class="itemize">
      <li>
        <p><span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> is the name of
        the Kattis problem. It is a single word and only uses
        characters a–z, no longer than 100 characters</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> is the name of
        the algorithm used to solve the Kattis problem. It is a
        single word and only uses characters a–z, no longer than
        100 characters</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> is an integer
        between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq N\leq
        100$</span>, which is the happy-points they get from
        solving the Kattis problem with the given method.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> is an integer
        between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq N\leq
        100$</span>, which is the amount of hours it takes to solve
        the Kattis problem, with the given method.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each Kattis problem can at most have 3 different methods of
    being solved.</p>
    <h2>Output</h2>
    <p>A single integer of the number of fingers/toes/hoves you see
    greeted with Your program should find the best possible
    combination of problems such that the sum of all points
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> is the highest
    possible value, while staying within the time limit. Output a
    single integer of the most amount of points the group can
    archive within the time limit.</p>
